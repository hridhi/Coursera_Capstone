# Introduction / Business Problem
Background
Suppose you got a promotion to be the CEO of your company . You are very happy about it, but there is one problem that you need to shift to a different city . Apparently  you don't have enough time to investigate which area and place is suitable for you to stay . There are many  websites that show the different areas where you can buy a house, but still  you have to spend time on finding a suitable neighbourhood for you similar to  your previous one . You also want the place to have different add on features like, which is near to your workplace,crime free and so on ..

How can you find a house in an unfamiliar environment  ?
Project idea 
Here comes my coursera_capstone project which will do the following functionalities: 
Firstly  the user enters the location of his workplace.
 Secondly the user is requested  to enter the location of his previous house or  he can just  add some  features like hospitals, crime free environment and many similar ones of how he wants his environment to be like 
We estimate the environment of the user's  previous house and extract features. 
Now we find the top 3 neighbourhoods according to the details provided by the user.
Then the user can choose the location of his choice and go ahead for shifting.
Who is this solution target to 
To all the people who travel to unknown cities and try to settle there for many reasons like job, education .They can have a safe and desirable neighbourhood where  they want to live in without wasting too much time on searching for it.
